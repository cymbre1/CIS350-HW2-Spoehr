### Technical Background
I first learned some programming when I started doing robotics in 8th grade and I ended High School being the programming team lead for my team. Then I started going to school for Computer Science and have gained skills and experience in my studies. Last summer I did an internship at Gentex Corporation where I worked for their Software Engineering Services team, meaning that I worked on PC applications for Linux computers to be used by other engineers throughout the company. I am currently working there part time in order to be able to accomodate my school schedule. I have also worked on various side projects with my husband who is a software engineer throughout the years that we've been together, we met in robotics in High School.
