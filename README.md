## Technical Background
I first learned some programming when I started doing robotics in 8th grade on Code Red Robotics, which I was involved in through High School. After High School, I started going to school for Computer Science and have just started my Junior year at Grand Valley State University. Last summer, I did an internship at Gentex Corporation where I worked for their Software Engineering Services team, meaning that I developed PC applications for Linux computers to be used by other engineers throughout the company. I am currently working there part time in order to be able to accommodate my school schedule.
